# chair_price-py

* So this is actually my second attempt at trying PyCharm, the first
time I gave up because I thought it was just painful to use but this
attempt went much easier. I felt when I tried the first time it wasn't
really straight to the point. I am really enjoying the virtual
environment functionality though. I'd been running into some pretty
annoying dependency issues recently that were starting to make me wonder
how i would handle them. So the ease of which PyCharm makes venv is
really great.

* This project is really simple, just gonna be some basic requests
and api type stuff, nothing heavy.
